Welcome to Sage's Reference Manual!
=================================================

This is the manual for the Sage mathematical software system. Sage
is free open source math software that supports research and
teaching in algebra, geometry, number theory, cryptography, and
related areas. Both the Sage development model and the technology
in Sage itself are distinguished by an extremely strong emphasis on
openness, community, cooperation, and collaboration: we are
building the car, not reinventing the wheel.

This reference manual contains many examples that illustrate the
usage of Sage. The examples are all tested with each release of
Sage, and should produce exactly the same output as in this manual,
except for line breaks.

The Sage command line is briefly described in :ref:`ch:cmdline`, which
lists the command line options. For more details about the command
line, see the Sage tutorial.

The Sage graphical user interface is described in
:ref:`ch:notebook`. This graphical user interface is unusual in that
it operates via your web browser. It provides you with Sage worksheets
that you can edit and evaluate, which contain scalable typeset
mathematics and beautiful antialiased images.
